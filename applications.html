                    <p>Drones in isolation, being relatively cheap but versatile, robust, and manoeuvrable, can perform a variety of tasks that were previously only achievable by humans. To date, drones are being deployed on a trial basis in search and rescue operations, assisting firefighters to extinguish hard-to-reach flames, and in overseas armed forces deployments to complete objectives which otherwise would put personnel at risk. Within these applications, there are situations where one would scale up these operations, utilising multiple drones to complete tasks more efficiently. There are several challenges associated with scaling up drone operations, especially in environments where a global communications backend for the drones may not exist. See for example the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/doi_droneinfographic_2.2018.pdf">US government DOI wildfire-fighting drones report</a>.<br />
                    <video controls class="full"> <source src="media4.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source> </video></p>
                    <p>In search and rescue operations, for example, the time needed to search through a well-defined area is directly related to the number of drones searching an area and the deployment of multiple drones to the operation could be the difference between the search time being infeasibly large and having the search completed within an optimal time period. Environmental factors could make it difficult to establish a global communications network between all the drones (e.g. through satellites) and each drone may only be able to communicate with n ≥ 1 drones at a given time. This being the case, the drones need to be able to make decentralised decisions, so the search operations are completed correctly and efficiently. If any of the drones were to fail, the whole search area should still be searched before the operation is declared to be complete. <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8775/16691214064_57d128a36d_b.jpg" alt="Nepal Drone Search And Rescue" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
                    <p>Drones have been used in combat deployments for many years now, but typically in isolation with a connection to a global network. There are, however, potential applications where you’d want to utilise drone swarms without access to a global communications backend. For example, drone swarms could be used to deploy a floating communications infrastructure on a battlefield where the environment does not facilitate a connection to a global backend. In this case, it’s important to have certain guarantees about whether messages have been delivered and to robustly cover the desired area if there are any failures in the swarm. If drone swarms were to be deployed directly for combat operations, the stakes become much higher. Each member of the swarm needs to be sure that all other members of the swarm are operating with shared knowledge for these operations to be carried out correctly, and any failure in the swarm needs to be detected as soon as possible to avoid compromising any strategic advantage one side may have. <img src="http://navylive.dodlive.mil/files/2013/05/130522-N-ZZ999-001-slider.jpg" alt="Unmanned Aerial Drone - US Navy" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
                    <p>In either of these scenarios, a failure to coordinate between the members of the swarm could threaten life, so precautions must be taken to minimise that risk. The research being undertaken sets out to write proofs on the algorithms used to coordinate drone swarms and increases confidence in drone swarms so they can be deployed more frequently, hopefully saving more lives in the process.</p>
